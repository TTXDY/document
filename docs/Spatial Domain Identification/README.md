# Spatial Domain Identification
RIF devises two pretext tasks tailored specifically for ST data: **domain classification task** and **gene imputation task**, addressing the following limitations:
1) Representations are not optimized for SDI, which further hindering the interpretation of the trained network for identifying key genes influencing clustering is difficult. 
2) The reconstruction pretext task is susceptible to the highly sparse and noisy gene expression.
